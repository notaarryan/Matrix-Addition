# Matrix Addition in Java

## Overview

This project implements matrix addition in Java, a fundamental operation in linear algebra. Matrix addition involves adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same dimensions to produce a new matrix. This project serves as a practical implementation of this mathematical concept, providing a simple and efficient solution for adding matrices.

## What is Matrix Addition?

Matrix addition is the process of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together. For two matrices \( A \) and \( B \) of the same size, the sum \( C \) is calculated as follows:

<i>C<sub>ij</sub> = A<sub>ij</sub> + B<sub>ij</sub></i>

where <i>C<sub>ij</sub></i>, <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>ij</sub></i> represent the elements at the ith row and jth column of matrices \( C \), \( A \), and \( B \), respectively. This operation is widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, scientific computing, and data analysis.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input matrices of any size, provided they have the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Addition Logic**: Implements the logic for adding corresponding elements of two matrices.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for mismatched matrix sizes.
