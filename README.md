# Matrix Addition in Java

## Overview

This project implements matrix addition in Java, a fundamental operation in linear algebra. Matrix addition involves adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same dimensions to produce a new matrix. This operation is widely used in various fields such as computer graphics, scientific computing, and data analysis.

## What is Matrix Addition?

Matrix addition is the process of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together. For two matrices A and B of the same size, the sum C is calculated as follows:

<i>C<sub>ij</sub> = A<sub>ij</sub> + B<sub>ij</sub></i>

where <i>C<sub>ij</sub></i>, <i>A<sub>ij</sub><i/>, and <i>B<sub>ij</sub></i> represent the elements at the ith row and jth column of matrices C, A, and B, respectively.

## Features

- **User Input**: The program accepts matrices of any size as input, provided they are of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Addition Logic**: Adds the corresponding elements of two matrices and outputs the resulting matrix.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for mismatched matrix sizes.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
